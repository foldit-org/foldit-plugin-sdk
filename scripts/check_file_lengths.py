"""Fail if any Rust source file exceeds the line gate.

Single source of truth for the gate: both `just file-lengths` and the
`file-lengths` CI job invoke this script, so the two cannot drift.

A file can opt out of the gate by placing the sentinel comment
`// foldit:allow-long-file` within its first few lines (mirrors a clippy
`#[allow(...)]`, but for this non-clippy check). Reserve it for files
whose length is intrinsic (e.g. an exhaustive unit-test module), not as a
way to dodge a real split.
